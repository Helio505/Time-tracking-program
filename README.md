# Time-tracking-program
This is the time tracking app I'm developing in Python. I was developing it for some time, now I'm uploading it to GitHub.

I'll create a better readme later, but the summary of how it works is: You create a project, then start the clock, when you are done, stop the clock. It will save the name of the task and time spent.

I recommend cloning the whole repository and getting the folder, this build is developed enough that the program is almost usable.
If you want to contribute, you can, but explain what you're doing. If you have any suggestions send them.
